This repository contains scripts and data used for doing the analysis for the master's thesis: 
Mapping volatiles that induce sensory responses in Delia antiqua: comparative identification across a set of crops
Student: Max Andersson, Supervisor: Sebastian Larsson Herrera, Co-supervisor Teun Dekker
Raw data for gathered and annotated volatilomes and olfactomes across the set of crops as well as Delia antiqua and Drosophila melanogaster can be found under /Data.
Each raw dataset is named after the crop followd by _Analysis, e.g. Onion_Analysis. 
Data also contains a key which is used to correct any mistakes with naming as well as mistakes with various chemical identifiers like CAS, SMILES or InChi.
The code is written in R and the code generates the following figures as well as a table string for LaTeX:
